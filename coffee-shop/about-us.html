        <p class="p1">
            It happens millions of times each week – a customer receives a drink from a Starbucks barista – but each
            interaction is unique.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            It’s just a moment in time – just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another
            outstretched hand.<br>
            But it’s a connection. <br>
            We make sure everything we do honours that connection – from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in
            the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly. <br>
            From our beginnings as a single store nearly forty years ago, in every place that we’ve been, and every
            place that we touch, we’ve tried to make it a little better than we found it.<br>
